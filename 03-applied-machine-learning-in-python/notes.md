# Week 1

## Key Concepts in Machine Learning

* **Supervised learning** Learn to predict target values from labelled data
    * **Classification** Target values are taken from a discrete set
    * **Regression** Target values are taken from a continuous set
* **Unsupervised learning** Find structure in unlabeled data
    * **Clustering** Find groups of similar instances in the data
    * **Outlier detection** Find unusual patterns

Steps in training a classifier

* Representation - Convert the input data to a form you can use to train/test your model. Could be extracting a set of features for an object.
* Evaluation
* Optimization

## Python Tools for Machine Learning

We will use `scikit-learn` for this course.
